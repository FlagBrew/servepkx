# servepkx-go by Allen Lydiard

This is a small program built in golang that allows you to upload a pokemon
or multiple pokemon to PKSM through it's wireless server feature.

Thank you to zaksabeast for a bit of logic that I borrowed from his 
servepkx-browser tool.

Currently the following OSes are supported

- Linux
- Windows

You can find the build for these OSes in their corresponding folder, along with
instructions on how to use the program.

You can also find the source code if you wish to look at it.
