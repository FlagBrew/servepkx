# servepkx

servepkx allows users to upload Pokemon files from their PC to PKSM.

Currently there are three versions of servepkx available:

- [Browser](https://github.com/FlagBrew/servepkx/tree/master/browser): This version runs in your browser and doesn't require you to have Java installed.
- [Java](https://github.com/FlagBrew/servepkx/tree/master/java): This version has a GUI for ease of use but requires Java to be installed.
- [Go](https://github.com/FlagBrew/servepkx/tree/master/go): This version supports drag'n'drop as well as folder uploading and can detect your 3DS's IP address automatically.
