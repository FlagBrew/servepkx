# servepkx

ServePK allows users to upload Pokemon from their PC to PKSM.

Currently there are three flavors of ServePK available

- [Browser](https://github.com/FlagBrew/servepkx/tree/master/servepkx-browser): This version runs in your browser and doesn't require you to have Java installed.
- [GUI](https://github.com/FlagBrew/servepkx/tree/master/servepkx-gui): This version has a GUI for ease of use but requires Java to be installed.
- [Go](https://github.com/FlagBrew/servepkx/tree/master/servepkx-go): This version supports drag'n'drop as well as folder uploading and can detect your 3DS's IP address automatically.
